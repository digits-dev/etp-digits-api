# ETP MW
ETPxDigits MW for API Integration
## Overview
This API serves as a middleware to facilitate seamless integration between Point of Sale (POS) systems and Oracle ERP. It enables the synchronization of key business data such as inventory updates between the POS terminals and Oracle's enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. The API ensures real-time data exchange to streamline operations, improve data accuracy, and enhance business process.

Key Features:
- Inventory Management: Update stock levels in Oracle ERP based on POS sales and returns to ensure proper inventory tracking.
- Error Handling & Logging: Robust logging and error-handling mechanisms ensure data integrity and provide traceability for failed transactions.

This API enhances efficiency by bridging data between front-end sales systems and back-end enterprise management, providing a unified view of operations.
